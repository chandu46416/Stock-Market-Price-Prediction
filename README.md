## Introduction

This project aims to analyze and forecast the volume of Apple stocks using various time series models. The steps include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, time series decomposition, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `datasets_302666_618181_AAPL.csv`: The dataset containing Apple's stock data.
- `Stock Price Prediction.ipynb`: The main script for data analysis and forecasting.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

1. **Run the Analysis Script:**
    ```bash
    python stock_analysis.py
    ```

2. **View the Results:**
    - The script will generate various plots and display model summaries.
    - Forecasted volumes will be compared with the actual volumes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `datasets_302666_618181_AAPL.csv`, which contains daily stock prices and volumes for Apple Inc. Ensure this file is in the same directory as the `stock_analysis.py` script.

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
    - Load the dataset using pandas.
    - Handle missing values and parse dates.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
    - Visualize stock volume trends and patterns.
    - Decompose the time series to identify trend, seasonality, and residual components.

3. **Stationarity Testing:**
    - Perform the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to check for stationarity.

4. **Model Building:**
    - Build ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX models.
    - Evaluate models using AIC and select the best parameters.

5. **Forecasting:**
    - Forecast future stock volumes using the built models.
    - Compare the forecasts with actual volumes.

## Results

- The project evaluates different models (ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX) based on their AIC values.
- Forecast accuracy is measured using RMSE and MAPE.
- The best-performing model is selected for forecasting.
